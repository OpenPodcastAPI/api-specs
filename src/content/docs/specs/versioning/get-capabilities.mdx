```
GET /{major_version}/capabilities
```

This endpoint informs clients of all capabilities supported by the server. This information MUST inform the client of any supported **optional** features as well as any configuration options associated with them.

Each capability is returned as an **object** containing key-value pairs representing the capability's settings. Clients SHOULD use this information to adjust their behavior.

## Parameters

| Field           | Type   | In   | Required? | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------ | ---- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `major_version` | String | Path | Yes       | The **major** version that the client wants to target. <br /> The server MUST return all supported features for **each** major version. |

## Client behavior

Clients SHOULD inform the user which features are supported by the server. Clients MAY also display information about relevant settings.

## Server behavior

The server MUST respond with all supported **optional** features and any associated settings. If a feature isn't enabled, the server MUST NOT include it in the response.
