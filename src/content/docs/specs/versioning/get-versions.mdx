```
GET /versions
```

This endpoint returns an array of versions supported by the server. This informs the client what **core** features are supported. The array MUST contain an entry for each **major** version supported by the server.

Versions follow the following format:

```
v{major_version}.{minor_version}
```

:::note
The `minor_version` MUST reflect the **highest** minor version supported by the server.
:::

| Field      | Type            | Required? | Description                  |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `versions` | Array\<String\> | Yes       | A list of supported versions |

## Client behavior

Clients SHOULD use the version number to adjust their behavior. For example, if the client is built with support for **v1.4** of the spec, and the server supports up to **v1.2**, the client should modify its calls to ensure they are compatible with **v1.2**.

## Server behavior

Servers MUST respond with all fields, including deprecated fields, to ensure that older clients can interpret the response properly.
