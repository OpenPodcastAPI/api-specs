## Server-side behavior

On receipt of a PATCH request for a subscription, the server MUST do the following:

1. If the subscription in the request has a `new_guid` specified in the database, follow the `new_guid` chain to find the **latest** version of the subscription
2. If the request contains a `new_feed_url` parameter:
   1. Update the subscription entry's `feed_url` field to the new value
   2. Update the subscription entry's `subscription_changed` field to the current date
3. If the request contains a `new_guid` parameter:
   1. Check if the GUID is already present in the system
   2. If the GUID is already present, update the subscription entry's `new_guid` field to point to the existing entry
   3. If the GUID isn't already present, create a new subscription entry and update the existing entry's `new_guid` field to point to the newly created entry
   4. Update the subscription entry's `guid_changed` to the current date
4. If the request contains an `is_subscribed` parameter:
   1. Update the subscription entry's `is_subscribed` to the new value
   2. Update the subscription entry's `subscription_changed` field to the current date
5. Return a summary of the changes
