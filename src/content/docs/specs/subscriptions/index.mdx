<CoreEndpoint />

The subscriptions endpoint is used to synchronize subscriptions between a server and connected clients. The server is treated as the authoritative source for subscription information. Clients can query the endpoint by specifying the datetime from which they want to fetch changes to ensure they only fetch information that is relevant to them since their last sync.

Subscriptions represent the feeds a user has subscribed to. A subscription object stores essential information about each subscription and acts as an index that links other activity information together.

| `subscription_changed` | Datetime       | No        | The date on which the `is_subscribed` field was last updated. Presented in [ISO 8601 format]                                                                        |
| `guid_changed`         | Datetime       | No        | The date on which the podcast's `guid` or `new_guid` was last updated. Presented in [ISO 8601 format]                                                               |

:::note[Tombstoning]
Servers **should** hold all previous `guid` and `feed_url` field data with a link to the succeeding data (such that a path of values can be followed) or with a link to the most recent data. This enables the server to handle situations in which clients submit old data. For example:
* A user finds a podcast, whose URL had changed, and adds the old URL in the app. Because the client doesn't have the old URL in its database, it recognizes the podcast as **new** and POSTs the `feed_url` to the `/subscriptions` endpoint. If the user is already subscribed to the podcast (with the current feed URL) this would lead to a duplicate subscription.
* A user has a device that they didn't use for a very long time. In that time, a podcaster added a GUID in their feed, leading to updated data in this field. When the client connects to the server again to pull all episode changes since the last connection, it retrieves episodes with their current subscription `guid`. The client won't recognize the subscription and fail to update the status of episodes.
