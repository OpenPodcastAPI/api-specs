GET /subscriptions/{guid}
```

This endpoint returns subscription information relating to a specific subscription for the authenticated user. It returns the following information:

| Field                  | Type           | Required? | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feed_url`             | String         | Yes       | The URL of the podcast RSS feed                                                                       |
| `guid`                 | String\<UUID\> | Yes       | The globally unique ID of the podcast                                                                 |
| `is_subscribed`        | Boolean        | Yes       | Whether the user is subscribed to the podcast or not                                                  |
| `subscription_changed` | Datetime       | No        | The date on which the `is_subscribed` field was last updated. Presented in [ISO 8601 format]          |
| `guid_changed`         | Datetime       | No        | The date on which the podcast's `guid` or `new_guid` was last updated. Presented in [ISO 8601 format] |
| `new_guid`             | String\<UUID\> | No        | The new GUID associated with the podcast                                                              |
| `deleted`              | Datetime       | No        | The date on which the subscription was deleted. Only returned if the field is not `NULL`              |

## Parameters

The client must send the subscription's `guid` in the path of the request.

## Server-side behavior

If the entry contains a `new_guid`, the server must return the newest `guid` associated with the entry in the response's `new_guid` field. For example: if a subscription has received 2 new `guid`s, the server should return:

- The subscription's `guid` passed in the request path
- The subscription's latest `guid` in the `new_guid` field

This ensures the client has the most up-to-date entry for the subscription.

## Client behavior

The client should update its local subscription data to match the information returned in the response. On receipt of a deleted subscription, the client should present the user with the option to remove their local data or [send their local data to the server](/specs/subscriptions/add-new) to reinstate the subscription details.
