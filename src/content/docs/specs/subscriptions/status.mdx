```http title="Endpoint"
GET /v1/deletions/{id}
```

This endpoint enables clients to query the status of a [deletion](/specs/subscriptions/delete). When a client sends a `DELETE` request, the server MUST respond with a `deletion_id` that can be used with this endpoint to check whether a deletion has been successfully actioned.

| `status`      | String  | Yes       | A status message indicating the status of the deletion. Available values: `SUCCESS`                 | `FAILURE` | `PENDING` |
| `message`     | String  | No        | A status message indicating the current status of the deletion, or any errors that were encountered |

## Parameters
