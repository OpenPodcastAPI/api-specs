```
GET /deletions/{id}
```

This endpoint enables clients to query the status of a [deletion](/specs/subscriptions/delete). When a client sends a `DELETE` request, the server must respond with a `deletion_id` that can be used with this endpoint to check whether a deletion has been successfully actioned.

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deletion_id` | Integer | Yes | The ID of the deletion object |
| `status` | String | Yes | A status message indicating the status of the deletion. Available values: `SUCCESS` | `FAILURE` | `PENDING` |
| `message` | String | No | A status message indicating the current status of the deletion, or any errors that were encountered |

## Parameters

The client must send the deletion's `id` in the path of the request.

## Example request

## Example 200 response

The server must send a `200 (Success)` if it can fetch a status object without issue. This response must contain information about the `deletion_id` passed in the query path.
