```http title="Endpoint"
GET /v1/capabilities
```

The capabilities endpoint exposes details about the features a server supports. Capabilities are scoped by `urn` and MUST contain the following:

- Each supported version of the feature.
- The `status` of the feature version: `STABLE` | `UNSTABLE` | `DEPRECATED`.

Each `capabilities` response MUST contain a `urn:opa:core` object that lists the versions of the Open Podcast API the server supports. Additional capabilities MAY be returned as separate `urn` objects with supported versions.

## Example 200 response

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "urn:opa:core": {
      "0.1.0": {
        "status": "STABLE"
      },
      "1.0.0": {
        "status": "UNSTABLE"
      },
      "0.0.1": {
        "status": "DEPRECATED"
      }
    },
    "urn:opa:extra:playcount": {
      "0.1.0": {
        "status": "STABLE"
      },
      "1.0.0": {
        "status": "UNSTABLE"
      },
      "0.0.1": {
        "status": "DEPRECATED"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
