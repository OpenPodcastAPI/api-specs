The Open Podcast API is subject to change over time. To ensure backwards compatibility and effective communication of server capabilities, the API specification MUST be versioned in a consistent way.

The specification follows the [Semantic versioning model](https://semver.org/). Each version of the specification MUST adhere to the following rules:

**Major** versions
: A major version update indicates that a breaking change has occurred. This is reserved for the deprecation, addition, or renaming of **core** capabilities.

**Minor** versions
: A minor version update indicates that a new **optional** feature has been added or that a **core** feature has received a non-breaking change. This can include the deprecation or addition of parameters or behaviors.

**Patch** versions
: A patch version update indicates that a small non-breaking change has been made to clarify a feature or address an issue with wording.

## Backwards compatibility

To maintain backwards compatibility between **minor** versions, no parameters nor endpoints may be removed without a **major** version change. Fields may be deprecated in favor of new behaviors, but when queried by an older client the server MUST respond with a compatible response.
