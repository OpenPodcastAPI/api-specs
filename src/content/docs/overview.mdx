## Supported features

:::caution[Important]
All specifications are currently 'in progress'. Breaking changes can occur as we implement specifications and address issues.
:::

The specification for [synchronizing subscriptions](/specs/subscriptions) is already available. We encourage all interested projects offering podcast listening and/or synchronization functionality to adopt and implement defined specifications.

## Core and optional functionality

To ensure that the end-user experience is consistent across implemenetations, the specifications mark endpoints and features as **Core** (required) and **Optional**.

**Core**
: The feature or endpoint must be supported by all clients and servers.

**Optional**
: The feature or endpoint is considered to be additional functionality. Clients and servers may optionally support any combination of these features. Any project implementing **Optional** functionality should inform users about what is supported.

**Core** features are determined during the specification process. They are subject to change, although a change is unlikely.
