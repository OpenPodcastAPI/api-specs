# Meeting Notes

This directory contains meeting notes for the Open Podcast API project. They are static copies serving as back-up and reference point from the documentation. Their 'live' counterparts are (currently) listed in the ['Meeting notes' GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/OpenPodcastAPI/discussions/35).

The files can be accessed via git, and added to GenAI tools with access to this GitHub repository. The files are not included in main website navigation by design.
