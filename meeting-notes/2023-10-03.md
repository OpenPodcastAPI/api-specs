# NLnet funding
OpenPodcastAPI has been selected for round two, but they sent us a number of questions. We will discuss them in a separate HedgeDoc document.

# Netlify / Starlight migration PR
Our Netlify Open Source plan request got rejected, probably because we were missing some of their [criteria](https://www.netlify.com/legal/open-source-policy/).
We will implement all of their criteria, e.g. a link to Netlify at the bottom of the project's homepage, and try again.

# Episode endpoint
- Episode identification is done by randomly generated UUIDs/GUIDs per episode
- Clients have to pull from the server before pushing, so that clients will have to do deduplication and episode mapping

# Subscriptions endpoint/Server implementation
While working on subscriptions endpoint in php (Nextcloud) server, it appeared a bit of a pain to implement support for XML. Cutting it could save us quite some time. TBC.

# (Authentication)
Expect discussions on scopes (e.g. enough to have 'core read' and 'core write'?).
