# Who has the authority of the GUID

* In the first place the RSS feed
* If thats not available the server might *optionally* ask podcastindex.org
* The client may send a `guid` in the `POST` request **only** if it is obtained from the RSS feed. The server accepts sent `guid` information as authoritative 
* The client already has the GUID from the feed
* The server (project) may decide to be as slim as possible, to the extent that it doesn't do any RSS fetching
* The server MUST return a `guid` immediately. This can either be the `guid` sent by the client **or** a generated `guid` if nothing is sent. An asynchronous task CAN fetch the RSS feed to check for a `guid` if one was generated, store an updated `guid` and put an 'updated since' flag to tell clients on next connect  to update this data.
  * In case a user subscribes to the same podcast though with different feed URLs while there is no `guid` that connects the two, or if a server is unresponsive and this causes issues, it is accepted that this can lead to duplicate subscriptions.

# Deletion process

* The `DELETE` verb should actually remove data as a cascade
    * The server should keep a record **only** of the GUID and mark it as deleted
    * The API should return a `410 GONE` status for any deleted entries
* The `PATCH` unsubscribe request marks all entries as **unsubscribed**
    * The server should not remove any data associated with **unsubscribed** subscriptions unless they are deleted
